## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of 
  skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- At first step I was getting training accuracy of 93% but validation accuracy was 54% only
- Above is the case of overfitting
- After using Augmentation and regularization training accuracy is dropped by 68% and validation accuracy is 55%
